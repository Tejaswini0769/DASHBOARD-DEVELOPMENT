DESCRIPTION:

This Power BI dashboard project is designed to analyze and monitor patient waiting lists across Inpatient and Outpatient categories from 2018 to 2021. The primary objective is to provide healthcare stakeholders with actionable insights into current waiting list statuses, historical trends, and detailed breakdowns by specialty and age profiles. The process began with stakeholder engagement to understand business goals and data requirements, followed by connecting data through folder-based CSV imports. The data was then transformed using Power Query, where inconsistencies were resolved, columns aligned, and datasets appended into a unified model. Relationships were created for effective filtering, and calculated DAX measures enabled dynamic reporting, including average vs. median comparisons. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations like cards, column charts, doughnuts, and a detailed matrix view, all designed with usability and clarity in mind. Final touches included dynamic titles, tooltips, and a styled background to enhance user experience, along with testing and interactivity features to prepare the solution for deployment and stakeholder use.
